# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLaMA 3 (8B)

A practical, hands-on project demonstrating how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the LLaMA 3 (8B) model, FAISS vector store, and Hugging Face embeddings.  
This project showcases how to integrate document retrieval into large language models for accurate, up-to-date, and authoritative responses.

## Project Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that improves the quality of language model outputs by fetching real-time information from external sources. This notebook provides a complete walkthrough — from loading documents to building a full RAG pipeline.

Key Features:
- Text extraction from PDF documents
- Chunking and embedding documents
- Vector similarity search using FAISS
- Augmented prompt creation
- Response generation via LLaMA 3 (8B) hosted through Groq
- End-to-end pipeline ready for deployment

---

## Tech Stack

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- FAISS — Vector store for fast similarity search
- HuggingFace — Embedding model: `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`
- LangChain — Orchestration of RAG pipelines
- LLaMA 3 (8B) via ChatGroq API
- PyMuPDF — Document loader for PDFs
- Streamlit / Gradio (optional) — For building a frontend interface
- Docker (optional) — For containerized deployment

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```git clone https://github.com/ahmad-meda/RAG-using-Llama3-8b.git```
```cd RAG-using-Llama3-8b```

### 2. Install Required Packages

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

If using a jupyter notebook, install using:

```pip install streamlit PyMuPDF langchain faiss-cpu huggingface-hub```  
```pip install langchain-community langchain-core langchain-groq```

---

### 3. Obtain Necessary API Keys

- Groq API Key (for LLaMA 3 inference): [Groq API Portal](https://groq.com)
- (Optional) HuggingFace Access Token if using private models

Add your keys into your environment variables or directly inside the notebook.

---

### 4. Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

`jupyter notebook`

Open `RAG_Llama8b.ipynb` and follow the steps.

## Key Concepts

### What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances an LLM’s capabilities by fetching external knowledge before generating a response, minimizing hallucination and outdated information issues.

### Why LLaMA 3?

- Handles long contexts (up to 8192 tokens)
- High efficiency and performance
- Excellent for retrieval-based applications

### How FAISS Helps?

- Allows fast, scalable retrieval of top-k most similar document chunks
- Essential for real-time search applications

---

## Example Usage

Once deployed, your RAG system will work like this:

1. User submits a query (e.g., "What is the mission statement?")
2. Query is embedded and compared against stored document chunks
3. Most relevant chunks are retrieved
4. LLaMA 3 receives both the query and retrieved chunks to generate a rich, accurate answer

---

## Future Improvements

- Add real-time document ingestion
- Integrate multi-modal support (text + images)
- Use advanced ranking algorithms for better chunk selection
- Fine-tune LLaMA 3 with custom datasets
- Full-fledged Streamlit Web App integration
